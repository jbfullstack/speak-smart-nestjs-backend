## Testing the app

**Demo Folder Contents**
For convenient testing of the application, the demo folder includes essential tools:

- Insomnia Collection: This collection is ready to be imported into Insomnia, a popular API client. It contains pre-configured requests tailored for testing various functionalities of our application.

- Shell Script for Automated Testing: We have provided a shell script that utilizes curl to interact with the application. This script is designed to:
  - Automatically create a new session.
  - Initiate a conversation in two modes:
    - Written Conversation Mode: First, the script engages in a text-based conversation, demonstrating how the application processes and responds to written inputs.
    - Verbal Conversation Mode: Subsequently, it switches to a verbal interaction mode, showcasing the application's ability to handle and respond to voice-based inputs.

**How to Use**

- Insomnia:
  Importing the Insomnia Collection:

  - Open Insomnia.
  - Go to 'Import/Export' and choose 'Import Data'.
  - Select 'From File' and navigate to the demo folder.
  - Choose the provided Insomnia collection file to import.

- Shell script:
  Running the Shell Script
  - Ensure curl is installed on your system.
  - Navigate to the demo folder in your terminal or command prompt.
  - Run the script using ./script_name.sh (replace script_name.sh with the actual script filename).

**_This setup provides a quick and easy way to test and understand the capabilities of the application, both in written and verbal communication contexts._**
